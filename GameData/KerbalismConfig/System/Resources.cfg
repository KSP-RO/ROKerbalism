// Stoppage = 1 - ((1 - AmountStoppedByKnownThickness)^(NewThickness / KnownThickness))
// Currently using aluminum. A 46 cm thick shield would block 93.3% of radiation, allowing crew to mostly below the max allowed radiation dose of 50 mSv/yr (on Earth).
// Assumes a stable radiation environment, unrealistic outside of a magnetosphere, so additional CME shielding (through parts) is needed
// double check: composite of HDPE and metals = 10g/cm² (100 kg/m²) resulting in a ~55% reduction of the effective dose. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5432003/
// at 0.2 shielding factor (= 9.2 g/cm²) we get a a 58% reduction, making this 14.6% better than the official source. To reduce the gap to 5.5%, we make the max thickness 50 cm instead of 46 cm.
