//
// Put desired scientific value into value, that will
// later be copied onto baseValue. We need to do this because KSP calculatesgit
// the size of an experiment thusly: dataScale * baseValue = size in Mb
//
// In Kerbalism terms...
// baseValue = the scientific value of an experiment (science points)
// dataScale = megabytes per science points
// scienceCap is irrelevant.
// ===================================================================================
// How to use IncludeExperiment: 
// Add a IncludeExperiment config field to the KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT node;
// Set it to another experiment id, multiple values allowed;
// Any science transmitted/recovered for the experiment will also be collected 
//  for every experiment defined in IncludeExperiment;
// This is based on science value, and processed when science is retrieved,
//  you won't see any file / data, and the science won't appear as "in flight" points
//  for the included experiments;
// You can chain multiple experiments : if A include B and B include C, collecting
//  science for A will collect it for B and C;
// Recovering points for an experiment will trigger the completion event (contracts)
//  every time the included experiment science value is reached. Ex :
//  if C value is 2 points and A value is 10 points, doing A will potentially
//  trigger the completion event for C 5 times (at 2/4/6/8/10 points), if you are transmitting.
//  If you recover it, the event will only be triggered once;
// Situation/body restrictions can be different between chained experiments;
// Included experiments are shown in the experiment part info / experiment popup / science archive UI;
