# ROKerbalism

#### Config for [Kerbalism](https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism) made to work for Realism Overhaul, with optional (and recommended) career integration through [RP-1](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0).

### Manual Installation

1. Use a new install or, alternatively, uninstall any other life support mods like TACLS or USI-LS.

1. Install RealismOverhaul and its dependencies by following the [official guide](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/Installation).

1. (Recommended) Install [RP-1](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-1/releases/latest) and its dependencies if you want to play in career.

1. Really, give the RO/RP-1 installation guide a thorough read, it contains a lot of useful info.

1. Copy the Kerbalism and KerbalismConfig folders to your GameData.

**Note:** the core folder from stock Kerbalism will work too, but you *must* get the config folder from ROKerbalism.

*Why would I install this?*

Kerbalism allows a much more in-depth simulation of crewed AND uncrewed missions. You'll now have to deal with radiation, stress and hard drives, and much more.
If you're used to TAC-LS, this is way more realistic and won't allow you a crewed Jupiter mission in a Mercury capsule without your astronaut going crazy. You'll also have to worry about Cosmic Background Radiation and solar weather, so mind your shielding.

If you're used to stock Kerbalism, this is still pretty different. The Reliability feature is disabled, for the moment, but spacecraft aren't customizable unless you use advanced near-future planetary habitats. Almost all historical parts have been given their real life support systems and recycling doesn't come until the ISS era.

If you're also playing RP-1, congratulations! You'll get a bunch of features that weren't previously possible. Thanks to the new features that have been introduced with Kerbalism 3.0, all experiments now take time; you can unlock life support subsystems and you can place them on old capsules to improve them. You'll also progress through various technologies that will reduce the weight of your life support system by a considerable amount, making crewed interplanetary more rewarding on the planning and progression side.

### ISRU
Thanks to Ballatik and his awesome research and configuration work (see [#54](https://github.com/Standecco/ROKerbalism/pull/54), [#64](https://github.com/Standecco/ROKerbalism/pull/64) and [#74](https://github.com/Standecco/ROKerbalism/pull/74) for more info), ROKerbalism is now on par with (and even surpasses) [RealISRU](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealISRU). You can create complex resource chains to produce CH-4, Hydrazine, HTP, and more. 

### Communications
Stock CommNet doesn't really cut it for ROKerbalism. For ultimate realism, balance and performance, you'll want to install [RealAntennas](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealAntennas). RemoteTech is incompatible, but not recommended for RO in general anyway.
